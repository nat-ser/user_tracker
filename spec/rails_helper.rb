# Requires supporting ruby files with custom matchers and macros, etc, in
# spec/support/ and its subdirectories. Files matching `spec/**/*_spec.rb` are
# run as spec files by default. This means that files in spec/support that end
# in _spec.rb will both be required and run as specs, causing the specs to be
# run twice. It is recommended that you do not name files matching this glob to
# end with _spec.rb. You can configure this pattern with the --pattern
# option on the command line or in ~/.rspec, .rspec or `.rspec-local`.
#
# The following line is provided for convenience purposes. It has the downside
# of increasing the boot-up time by auto-requiring all files in the support
# directory. Alternatively, in the individual `*_spec.rb` files, manually
# require only the support files necessary.

        Delete line `config.use_transactional_fixtures = true` from rails_helper.rb
        (or set it to false) to prevent uncommitted transactions being used in
        JavaScript-dependent specs.
        During testing, the Ruby app server that the JavaScript browser driver
        connects to uses a different database connection to the database connection
        used by the spec.

        This Ruby app server database connection would not be able to see data that
        has been setup by the spec's database connection inside an uncommitted
        transaction.
        Disabling the use_transactional_fixtures setting helps avoid uncommitted
        transactions in JavaScript-dependent specs, meaning that the Ruby app server
        database connection can see any data set up by the specs.
